# IntechDemoUnity
A simple samble game with Unity

## Objectif

Sample for Unity discovery, it's a space Invader clone

## HowToPlay
Just clone the repository and open the folder with Unity's "OpenProject". Then Launch the game by loading the "MiniGame-Invader" and press launch Button
You can move your ship with left and right arrow and fire with space bar.
If you are hit by a plasmaball the game will restart.

## About the comment
The ShipBehavior class is well commented (in french, dont hit me!) and describe the main feature of basic unity game. (event manager, 3D edit, compnent loading)

## About git
To facilitate the git and char analysis, the whole Unity project has ben switched to Text only. It is done by using Edit>projectSettings>Editor paneland switch the Asset serialization to "force text"
It will change the whole projects files of the unity project to "text only" char... And make git happy :)
